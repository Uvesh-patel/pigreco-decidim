      <li>Economic vulnerability: Business interruption and long-term recovery challenges</li>
      <li>Institutional vulnerability: Governance and coordination capabilities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Integrated Risk Modeling</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-criteria risk assessment incorporating all dimensions</li>
      <li>Scenario-based analysis for emergency planning</li>
      <li>Probabilistic risk assessment for long-term planning</li>
      <li>Cost-benefit analysis for prioritizing mitigation measures</li>
      <li>Dynamic risk modeling accounting for temporal changes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li><strong>Phase 2 (6 months):</strong> Hazard, exposure, and vulnerability assessment</li>
  <li><strong>Phase 3 (3 months):</strong> Risk modeling and scenario development</li>
  <li><strong>Phase 4 (6 months):</strong> Risk reduction strategy development and implementation planning</li>
  <li><strong>Phase 5 (ongoing):</strong> Monitoring, evaluation, and updating</li>
</ul>

<h4>Expected Outcomes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Comprehensive earthquake risk atlas accessible to all stakeholders</li>
  <li>Community-validated priority areas for structural and non-structural interventions</li>
  <li>Targeted risk reduction strategies with clear implementation pathways</li>
  <li>Enhanced community risk awareness and preparedness</li>
  <li>Decision-support system for land use planning and building regulations</li>

    body: { en: "<h3>Proposal for a Next-Generation Multi-Hazard Early Warning System</h3>

<p>Current early warning systems in our region operate in silos, with separate systems for different hazards, inconsistent messaging, and gaps in reaching vulnerable populations. I propose developing an integrated multi-hazard early warning system (MHEWS) that leverages modern technology and social science to create a comprehensive, people-centered approach.</p>

      <li>Automated translation into multiple languages and accessible formats</li>
      <li>Feedback mechanisms to confirm receipt and understanding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Response Capacity</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-defined response protocols linked to warning levels</li>

  <li><strong>Historical Timeline</strong>: Documenting past events and their impacts</li>
  <li><strong>Seasonal Calendar</strong>: Mapping temporal patterns of different hazards</li>
  <li><strong>Social Vulnerability Mapping</strong>: Identifying where vulnerable groups are located</li>
  <li><strong>Resource Mapping</strong>: Documenting critical infrastructure and emergency resources</li>
</ul>

<h4>Who Should Participate</h4>
<p>We encourage participation from diverse community members, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Long-term residents with historical knowledge</li>
  <li>Community leaders and representatives</li>
